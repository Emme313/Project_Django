_Over the Rabbit Hole_ (OTRH) is a browser-based app where users can create "playlists" of YouTube videos without all the distractions of YouTube. The layout is intentionally simple to help facilitate this goal.

#### User Stories
_ORTH_ was designed with everyone in mind. The following user stories were taken into consideration when building the OTRH app:

- As a person who is easily distracted, I want to enjoy YouTube without further temptation so that I can enjoy the desired content.
- As a car-/homeowner, I want to be able to easily keep track of the repair/home improvement videos I've chosen for future reference so that I can remain focused on my original goal.
- As a current student, I want to keep track of all my helpful tutorial videos without further diversions so that I may complete my assignments efficiently, on time.

#### Wireframes

#### Current Features & Future Goals
This app features full CRUD capability for all end users who create an account, either through OTRH directly, or by authorizing use of their Google account logins instead.

- Updates to CSS
- Merging logins and user accounts
- Allowing users to choose other external sources for account creation such as Facebook, Twitter, or GitHub
